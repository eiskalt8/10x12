# 10x12
10x12 is a dice game that my family learned on vacation. I haven't found anything familiar to this game in the internet, if you know this game and the real name of it, feel free to contact me!
At the moment I study business informatics in Germany and for a module we had to program a web project and write a documentation about it and yeah, here it is ;-). I'm still learning programming, so please don't judge my skills or my way of coding.

## Infrastructure
I used an nginx as a reverse proxy for a gunicorn web server which hosts the flask application. This project is currently available at [10x12.run.place](https://10x12.run.place)
