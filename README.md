# 10x12
10x12 is a dice game, which my family learned in vacation. I didn't found something familar to this game in the internet, if you know this game and the real name of it feel free to reach out to me!
Currently I study Business Informatics in Germany and for a modul we should code a webproject and write a documentation about it and yeah here it is ;-). I'm still learning programming, therefore please don't judge my skill or way of coding.

## Infrastructure
I used an nginx as a reverse Proxy for a Gunicorn Webserver, which hosts the flask application. This Project is currently available under [10x12.run.place](https://10x12.run.place)
